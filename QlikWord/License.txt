(ii) replace or modify the Software so that it becomes non- infringing while retaining substantially similar functionality; or (iii) if neither of the foregoing remedies can be reasonably effected by Qlik, terminate the license(s) for the subject Software (without need for a ruling by a court or arbitrator) and refund to Licensee a pro rata portion of the license fees received by Qlik with respect thereto, amortized over three (3) years on a straight-line basis, provided that such Software is returned to Qlik promptly after the effective date of any such termination.

Any Party’s disclosure of the other Party’s Confidential Information may be made only to those of its employees or consultants who need to know such information in connection herewith and who have agreed to maintain the Confidential Information as confidential as set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information to the extent that it is required to be disclosed in accordance with an order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental  body,  provided  that  such  Party,  to  the  extent
permitted by law, provides the other Party with prompt notice of such order or requirement in order that it may seek a protective order. A Party’s obligations with respect to confidentiality hereunder will continue for a period of five (5) years following any termination of this Agreement, provided, however, that each Party’s obligations will survive and continue in effect thereafter with respect to, and for so long as, any Confidential Information continues to be a trade secret under applicable law.

If Licensee: (i) obtains its Software license key(s) from QlikTech GmbH, as set forth in Table 1 of this Agreement; and (ii) usually resides in Germany or Austria, then Section 3 does not apply. Instead, Qlik warrants that the initial version of the Software delivered hereunder (but excluding any updates thereto provided as a result of Maintenance) provides the functionalities set forth in the Documentation (the “agreed upon functionalities”) for the limited warranty period following the Delivery Date when used on the recommended hardware configuration. As used in this Section, “limited warranty period” means one (1) year. Non- substantial variation from the agreed upon functionalities shall not be considered and does not establish any warranty rights. To make a warranty claim, Licensee must notify Qlik in writing during the limited warranty period.

8.8.5.	Additional Warranty Terms for Users in Australia. Without limiting the provisions of Section 3, if Licensee (i) obtains its license key(s) from QlikTech Australia Pty, Ltd, as set forth in Table 1 of this Agreement; and (ii) is a “consumer” under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), then (a) to claim a breach of any warranty under this Agreement,  Licensee must notify Qlik by the dates set out in Section 3.1 by contacting Qlik at the address indicated in Table 1 of this Agreement; (b) Licensee will bear the expenses of claiming the warranty; (c) the benefits to Licensee given by each warranty under this Agreement are in addition to other rights and remedies of Licensee under a law in relation to the goods or services to which the warranty relates; and (d) Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law.

non-production environment and for the period limited by the corresponding license key.  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Evaluation Licenses for the Software are provided “AS-IS” without indemnification, maintenance and support, or warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.
8.9.	Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events, which occur after the effective date of this Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control of the parties, such as strikes, blockade, war, terrorism, riots, natural disasters, refusal of license by the government or other governmental agencies, in so far as such an event prevents or delays the affected Party from fulfilling its obligations and such Party is not able to prevent or remove the force majeure at reasonable cost.
8.10.	Notices. All notices and other communications given or made pursuant to this Agreement concerning a breach, violation or termination hereof will be in writing and will be delivered: (a) by certified or registered mail; or (b) by an internationally recognized express courier.

Any additional or conflicting terms or conditions in any purchase order or other ordering documentation shall have no legal force or effect.
8.13.	Equitable Relief. Licensee acknowledges that Qlik may be irreparably harmed by a breach of the terms of this Agreement and that damages, alone, may not be an adequate remedy. Licensee agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies permitted under applicable law, Qlik will have the right to enforce this Agreement by injunctive or other equitable relief without the need to prove actual damages or post a bond.
8.14.	Limitation. Subject to applicable law, no action, regardless of form, arising out of this Agreement may be brought by Licensee more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.
8.15.	Entire Agreement; Severability. This Agreement is the complete statement of the mutual understanding of the Parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Licensee has entered into a separate written agreement with a Qlik entity prior to the Delivery Date which is intended to govern Licensee’s current Software and Maintenance purchase, then the terms of that separate agreement will govern in place of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in force and effect. The English language version of this Agreement shall be the version used when interpreting or construing this Agreement.
8.16.	U.S. Government End Users. The Software and Documentation are deemed to be “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212(b), as applicable. Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performing, displaying or disclosing of the Software and Documentation by the U.S. Government shall be governed solely by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
